Noble's Landing Site Features
--------------

This site is meant to be an easy-to-use resource for Noble's Landing guests.  It is being kept
fairly "light weight" (e.g. no pictures) to make it easy to load and use in places where
an internet connection is slow (like the beach).  As well, the site should be usable 
on computers, tablets and phones.


--------------
User Accounts
--------------
Some sections of the site can be viewed without logging in, while some other sections require it.
It will be noted throughout this doc when login is required.  If you are logged in, your name
will display at the top right on header (with dropdown links to profile and sign out)

Notable Features:
- Local accounts can be created by Admin users
- Facebook and Google authentication is allowed.  Once authenticated the following occurs:
	- If it is the first auth, a user is created in a disabled state
	- Disabled user will have to be enabled by a site Admin user
	- Once enabled, user can use facebook/google login to sign in and out of the site
	- This flow prevents allowing everyone from Facebook/Google having access to the site
- Users can be disabled at Admin discretion
- User accounts can be made into Admin by other Admins
- Admin accounts can create or modify any dynamic content on the site (Guest Logs, Lists, etc)
- Users can edit their own profiles.
- Admins can edit anybody's profile.
